* Isometric tiles
** [[isoTest.org]] demonstrates isommetric rendering
** Use diagonal coordinates
** Coords are stored in data-coords in image-holder divs
** Convert view coords to map coords (always showing an offset in the map)
* 2D levels only to start with
** Move to full 3D later
*** 2D levels with "connectors" like stairs?
*** Level editor can swap floors that are above each other
**** editor would present Leisure content selectively (new type of view)
